tenshi (0.4-1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload to hopefully fix the final glitches in former
    NMUs. It seems that some ugly spell has been sent towards tenshi.

    appear on the l10n coordination pages

tenshi (0.4-1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload to really fix the issue fixed in the former NMU
  * Use dh_installdirs instead of "cp -r" to guarantee that subdirs of
    /etc/tenshi. This really Closes: #407105

tenshi (0.4-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload to fix an RC bug and
    longstanding debconf abuse
  * Include the includes-active in directories created under
    /etc/tenshi
  * Remove the debconf note. Closes: #357596
    This also removes the need for translations.
    Sorry to the Czech translator. Closes: #360284
    This also fixes the incorrect debconf dependency that was
    blocking the cdebconf transition.
  * Lintian fix:
    - Add a LSB header to the init script
