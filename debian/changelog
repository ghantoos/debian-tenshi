tenshi (0.11-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Bumped Standards-Version to 3.9.1.
    - Added Vcs-Svn and Vcs-Browser.
    - Set debhelper dependency to (>= 7.0.8) as dh_overrides are not used by
      debian/rules anymore.
  * debian/postinst:
    - Changed tenshi user home directory from /var/run/tenshi to 
      /var/lib/tenshi as files in /var/run are cleared at boot time.
      This made the package upgrade from lenny to squeeze fail.
      Thank you Lucas Nussbaum for spotting this issue. 
      (Closes: #605240, #606789)
  * debian/patches:
    - 20-manpage.diff: Added typo correction in manpage.
  * debian/source:
    - Added format file set to "1.0".
  * debian/rules:
    - Removed the dh_installinit override, in order to stop the tenshi script
      before upgrading the package. This will be applicable during the next
      upgrade.
  * debian/preinst:
    - Added this pre-installation script in order to stop the tenshi daemon
      before starting the upgrade to the current release. This had to be
      done as the -R flag was passed to dh_installinit in previous release.
  * debian/postrm:
    - Replaced deluser(8) with userdel(8) as adduser package is purged before
      tenshi. Thank you Hideki Yamane <henrich@debian.or.jp> for the patch.
